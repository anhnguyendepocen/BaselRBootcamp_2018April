## What is CARET?

- Classification and Regression Training
  - Written by Max Kuhn, is the go-to package for ML in R.

## Why use caret?

- Gives you access to hundreds of ML algorithms in R with a **common** interface.
    - You don't need to learn all of the unique inputs for each algorithm, it's all the same!

- Split / sample data

- Feature Selection
    - Makes it easy to select *features* from a dataset that seem reasonable

- Model tuning
    - Helps you to easily tune models to your unique dataset

## Feature selection

- We have 10s, 100s, or 1000s of 'features', how do we narrow these down?
    - Why do we want to narrow them down?
        - Unncessary computation, comprehensibility.
        - Some columns we know are useless (e.g.; person's name)
    - What is an unncessary feature?
        - No variance
        - Perfectly correlated with another feature (e.g.; weight_lb, weight_kg)
        - Nominal features with the same number of levels as datapoints (e.g.; names)

- Start by asking yourself "What features in the data do I explicitly want to ignore?"
    - It's almost always better to use content knowledge before setting an algorithm loose on data.


## Imputing missing values



### Engineering

- Feature Engineering means creating *new* features based on existing ones.

- Examples
   - Extracting sentiment from text
   
   

### Key caret functions

- `preProcess`: Transforms data, fill in missing values, 
- `createDataPartition`: Splicts data using stratified sampling
- `train`: Estimate model parameters, evaluate the effect of model parameters on fitting performance, choose 'optimal' parameter values for a dataset.
- `confusionMatrix`: Get model fit statistics for classification
- `resamples` Collect, summarise, and contrast the perofrmance of different models
